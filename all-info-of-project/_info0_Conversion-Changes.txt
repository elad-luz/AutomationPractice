==============
 General INFO 
--------------

Create an automation framework for one of the next sites:
you can take  ->  https://www.temp.com/

• Before you start your automation you must write STD in excel or in a test case management (test title, step description, expected result...)
• Use TestNG annotations (@BeforeClass, @Test, @AfterClass…) to write your tests (we do not use the main class anymore:))
• Use assertions to decide if your tests passed/failed
• It is recommended to use DataProvider option in your tests.
• Create testng.xml and run all classes together (see results in the TestNG Reports)
• It is Recommended to add Maven + Allure + Git.
 
Tips:
-› Improve your code by using PageFactory and @FindBy annotation - if you didn’t already do it
-› Do not forget to use BasePage, BaseTest
-› Use the code we used in the class for help
-› Use the page object concept to create a page for each page and add: 
-› WebElements
-› Functions to support your tests scenario. 
-› Functions for validation
===========================


Converting to Maven:
--------------------
-> in this case <project> is: 'AutomationPractice':
After Convert the project to Maven you need to change locations in code of the followings:
1.	in class:  ConfPropertiesUtil  -of-  package:  /<project>/src/test/java/tempSite.utilities  --> change to tempSite (as needed)
	change path to: FileInputStream("./src/test/resources/tempSite/configuration.properties"))
2.	in class:  BaseTest  -of-  package:  /<project>/src/test/java/tempSite.testcases
	change path to: FileUtils.copyFile(srcFile, new File("./test-screenshots/" ...    ---> Needed only once !
3.	in class:  S01_LoginTests  -of-  package:  /<project>/src/test/java/tempSite.testcases  --> change to tempSite (as needed)
	change path to: excelPath = System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/src/test/resources/tempSite/inputTestData.xlsx";
4.	Make sure <project>\testng.xml is pointing to proper PROJECT !!!
5.	Make sure <project>\pom.xml is pointing to proper PROJECT in <artifactId> & <name> etc.
