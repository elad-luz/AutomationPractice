================================
 Page Object Model (POM) TestNG
--------------------------------

Maven POM
A Project Object Model or POM is the fundamental unit of work in Maven.
It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.
It contains default values for most projects.

NOTE -> You need to work on the Package code classes, not in the src folder

RUN EXAMPLE:
------------
from project path, via cmd run maven: mvn clean test
suiteXmlFile (in pom.xml), states which testNG file to use for the Run!

open CMD -> get to the project folder -> issue run command  (with clean):
C:\Users\USER>cd C:\Users\USER\eclipse-workspace\SeleniumWithMavenProject
C:\Users\USER\eclipse-workspace\SeleniumWithMavenProject>mvn clean test

Note:
if you use params in testNG.xml <parameter name=""baseUrl" value="https://www.saucedemo.com/" />
and you want to run a specific test class, via maven (bypassing the testNG.xml), you'll need to:
put the param in the pom xml under <systemPropertyVariables>
<baseUrl>https://www.saucedemo.com/</baseUrl>
Using Property Param via mvn pom.xml (instead of via testng.xml) is not relevant in my case --
Because I am using a dedicated properties file (residing in resources) !!!


pom.xml EXAMPLE: see in root of project !
